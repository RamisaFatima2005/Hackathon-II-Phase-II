## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

The agent has completed all backend setup and foundational tasks, as well as backend implementation for User Story 1. However, frontend project initialization (T005) remains blocked due to persistent issues. Tasks T005 and T006 are marked as blocked. The agent has summarized the current status and is awaiting user direction on how to proceed, offering options to re-attempt frontend setup, explore alternatives, or pause frontend development.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Backend development is complete up to the current stage. Frontend development is blocked, and user input is required for the next steps.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were executed.
- 📁 Files:
    - `specs/001-fullstack-todo-app/tasks.md` (Modified to reflect blocked tasks)
- 🔁 Next prompts: The agent awaits user direction on how to proceed, providing options for handling the blocked frontend tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent has accurately assessed the project's status, identified the blocking issue, and is proactively seeking user guidance, as per operational guidelines.
