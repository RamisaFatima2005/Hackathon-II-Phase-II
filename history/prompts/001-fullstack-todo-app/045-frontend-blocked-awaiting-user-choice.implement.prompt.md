## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

The agent has completed all available backend tasks and confirmed that frontend initialization (T005) is blocked due to persistent issues with timeouts and interactivity. Tasks T005 and T006 are marked as blocked. The agent has reiterated the current project status and is awaiting user direction on how to proceed, offering specific options for handling the blocked frontend tasks.
