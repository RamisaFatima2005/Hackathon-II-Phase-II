  I have redesigned the "Edit Task" page UI in `frontend/src/app/task/[id]/edit/page.tsx` to align with the existing application theme.
  This included updating the container, headings, labels, input fields, checkboxes, and buttons to use consistent styling, spacing, and animations, ensuring a professional, clean, modern, and responsive design.
